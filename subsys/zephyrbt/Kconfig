	help
	  The behaviour tree will check to call k_yield() to give opportunity
	  to same threads to execute. This do not affect the time slice
	  configuration and both can be used.

	  The time slice can be useful when a very long action may block tree
	  walk. To enable time slice make sure that behaviour tree priority is
	  greater than TIMESLICE_PRIORITY and TIMESLICING=y.

	  If you want to have best walk performace you should disable this
	  option. If you do that you can have side effects like starvation and
	  may not attend all interrupts depending of the priority you select.

	  If you do not know what you are configuring leave as is.
